Example of output ranges include 0-20mV and 0-1v for a voltage output.

This should not be surprising since we are usually measuring analogue changes in the atmosphere. What we refer to as a digital sensor is merely an analogue sensor with extra built-in electronics and processing to make the analogue measurement and transmit an actual reading. In fact, digital sensors are more properly called 'instruments' since they consist of more than just an analogue sensing element.</p><p id="1484847341#-mwc9fx_48">Such instruments are easier to connect to another digital device such as a PC since most computers don't have the electrical interfaces required to accurately measure small voltages, current or resistance, but they do normally need some configuration before use. Analogue sensors tend to be simpler and don't require configuration and setup, however you need to connect them to a specialist device such as a datalogger that has the electrical interfaces that can measure analogue inputs accurately and stably. The conversion to a usable, digital value is then done by the dataloggers internal processing, usually under the control of a datalogger program.</p><p id="1484847341#-mwc9fx_49">These days, many sensors can provide both digital and analogue outputs.

Under the control of the logger program the analogue output can be converted to a digital value representing the parameter we are trying to measure. You can read more about the process of analogue to digital conversion here (<a href="https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/combination/analogue-to-digital-converter.html">https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/combination/analogue-to-digital-converter.html</a>).</p><p id="1484847341#-mwc9fx_52">In addition to the ADC, the datalogger usually has two types of terminal connection for analogue inputs:</p><ul class="list" id="1484847341#-mwc9fx_53" start="1"><li class="list-item" id="1484847341#-mwc9fx_57"><p><span class="control" id="1484847341#-mwc9fx_59">Single ended (SE)</span> - one wire of the sensor is connected to an SE input terminal and the other wire to an earth terminal. This way we measure our analogue signal with reference to earth. For higher signal output voltage levels e.g. 0-1 volts, this works fine but for lower output voltages e.g ( 10 millivolts) an incorrect reading could occur due to electrical noise on the inputs which could be attributed to the sensor itself.</p></li><li class="list-item" id="1484847341#-mwc9fx_58"><p><span class="control" id="1484847341#-mwc9fx_60">Differential (H/L)</span> - For low output signals mentioned above it is better to use a differential input.

Now we are measuring the output voltage difference between the two terminals rather than taking a measurement referenced to ground, this method helps to negate any electrical noise on the inputs since such noise will be affecting both inputs simultaneously.

These types of sensors can also be connected to laptop/PC using a USB to RS232/485 converter, which is useful since the best way to set up these sensors (e.g. message output type, units, interval between data transmissions etc.) is using 'terminal' software or a manufacturers software application.

The logger can also be used to control relays and switches. Unlike a microprocessor such as a Raspberry Pi type device, a logger has multiple input and output ports built-in to facilitate the connection of a large number of different types of sensors. Dataloggers are similar to microcontrollers in that have an operating system and can run a user written program but the hardware and operating system is optimised for collecting and storing data real time from multiple inputs.</p><p id="-1135713831#fo1zht_4">Due to their limited market, specialist nature, rugged construction, high quality electronics, thorough testing and calibration, dataloggers cost considerably more than generic processing units. At the time of writing a CR1000X datalogger costs approximately &pound;2000.</p><p id="-1135713831#fo1zht_5">To use a datalogger such as this, the user must set up the logger using the manufacturers provided configuration utility before connecting a sensor to the correct input ports. A logger program must then be written to tell the logger:</p><ul class="list" id="-1135713831#fo1zht_6" start="1"><li class="list-item" id="-1135713831#fo1zht_9"><p>What sensors are connected and in what way.</p></li><li class="list-item" id="-1135713831#fo1zht_10"><p>What data to collect from the sensors.</p></li><li class="list-item" id="-1135713831#fo1zht_11"><p>How to store the data (the logger uses its internal memory to store as much data as it can).</p></li><li class="list-item" id="-1135713831#fo1zht_12"><p>How to send the data to a remote server (loggers can also store data to a memory card).</p></li><li class="list-item" id="-1135713831#fo1zht_13"><p>How often you wish to get data from the sensor.</p></li><li class="list-item" id="-1135713831#fo1zht_14"><p>Apply any processing to the raw sensor data (e.g. calculating a mean or max value over a time period).</p></li></ul><section><h2 id="-1135713831#campbell-scientific-cr1000x" data-toc="campbell-scientific-cr1000x#Dataloggers.md-campbell-scientific-cr1000x">Campbell Scientific CR1000X</h2><p id="-1135713831#fo1zht_15">The datalogger most commonly in use within the Met Office at this time is the Campbell Scientific CR1000X (<a href="https://www.campbellsci.eu/cr1000x">https://www.campbellsci.eu/cr1000x</a>).

Within CRBasic programs, data storage is typically achieved through the use of table structures. These tables are essentially organized arrays where data collected from sensors or calculated values are stored.</p><p id="-82728123#r7f597_19">A data table is essentially a file that resides in data logger memory. The file consists of five or more rows. Each row consists of columns, or fields. The first four rows constitute the file header. Subsequent rows contain data records. Data tables may store individual measurements, individual calculated values, or summary data such as averages, maximums, or minimums.</p><p id="-82728123#r7f597_20">Typically, files are written to based on time or event. The number of data tables is limited to 250, which includes the Public, Status, DataTableInfo, and ConstTable. You can retrieve data based on a schedule or by manually choosing to collect data using data logger support software.</p><p id="-82728123#r7f597_21">Defining variables and data tables appropriately in the CRBasic program helps simplify accessing and processing the stored data values later.</p><div class="container"><figure class="image-container"><img class="center image image-size" id="-82728123#r7f597_22" alt="Datatable example" title="Datatable example" src="/home/h06/mabaker/PycharmProjects/Datalogger-sensors-training/Writerside/images/datatable_example.svg" width="1550" height="640"><figcaption class="center-text">Datatable example</figcaption></figure></div></section><section><h2 id="-82728123#constants-variables-and-alias" data-toc="constants-variables-and-alias#Datalogger-programming-intro.topic-constants-variables-and-alias">Constants, variables and alias</h2><p id="-82728123#r7f597_38">A <span class="emphasis" id="-82728123#r7f597_46">constant</span> is value declared at the beginning of a program.
